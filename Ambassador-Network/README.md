Ambassador-Network
==================

A worldwide network for Governance 2.0 enthusiast to empower entrepreneur-ambassadors to implement voluntary Do-It-Yourself governance solutions in their geographical context

The Bitnation business model is based on leveraging the worldwide Ambassador Network.  This network is composed of a global team of Ambassador-Entrepreneurs (generally Bitcoin entrepreneurs, particularly in emerging and frontier markets) who promote, implement, and support the Bitnation platform at a local level.

The system is composed of a human-centered, purpose driven partnering approach and commercialization model of collaborative intelligence. This model allows for the merging of multiple forms of crowd sourcing and funding inside of the governance collaboration platform that allows consumers to become investors and creative contributors to become entrepreneurs.

The Bitnation Platform will enable Ambassadors to empower themselves, their families, friends and neighbours to increase, realize and capitalize the value of their collective creativity in solving the problems and satisfying their governance needs.


How Does The Process Work?
==================

### Step 1: Research and assessments

An Ambassador organize meetups in the community to discuss what the community needs may be in the area (land deeds, security, dispute resolution, or anything else). The ambassador can also conduct polls, as well as gathering reports on the subject to gain a better understanding of the problem.

The ambassador identifies one or several key problems, and the Bitnation DApps that can solve them. 

### Step 2: Preparation

The Ambassador connects with the other ambassadors to see if someone else have implemented a similar DApp, and be able to learn from their experience.

The Ambassador gets help from Bitnation and the other ambassadors to get tutorials etc, to explain to the local community -- how the blockchain works, and how it can solve their specific problem. 

### Step 3: Pilot

The Ambassador conducts a pilot in their community, to test the Bitnation DApp.

The Ambassador records a video of the event, to share and inform others on the process used. Ideally it’s a live broadcast, so others can watch and come with questions and advice throughout the process.

After the pilot, the Ambassador collects feedback from the participants on possible improvements of the process/ functions, and write it up in a paper, or a blog post for community input.

### Step 4: Improving the product

The Ambassador Network and Bitnation discuss the assessment, and how to improve the DApp. Bitnation incorporates the feedback into the DApp to improve it for other users.

The Ambassador can choose to fork the DApp, to modify it to the specific local context they’re in. They can put their own branding on it, and share the DApp, or give it away for free through the Bitnation DApp store. If the Ambassador choose to fork the DApp and create their own, the Bitnation team can support them with marketing, development resources, and organizational advice.

The Ambassador takes the improved DApp back to their local community, for commercialisation and implementation.

Hence, beyond doing social good in their community  -- the Ambassadors also have an financial and entrepreneurial incentive: they can build their own DApp bussines on top of it. Bitnation get instant implementation all around the world, and a direct information feedback loop, which helps to develop and improve the governance tools.


Selection of Ambassadors
==================

Ambassadors appoint themselves through sending in their resume, biography and photo on the https://www.bitnation.co website, with a motivation letter on why they want to be Ambassadors. 

Unless someone is entirely non-appropriate for the role, e.g. are pro-centralised governance, etc, they will be given a Bitnation ID, an email address, and access to the Skype chats, trello board, and other coordination tools. 

Ambassadors can only be ejected from the network if they commit active sabotage, or disturb the work of other Ambassadors. 


Software
==================

https://github.com/Swarmops/Swarmops

The Ambassador Network will use Swarmops, which is a HR system built for voluntary, decentralized cooperative organizations. It pushes authority and decision-making power to the edges by design, and is built on the philosophy that everybody in an organization is, at least in some aspect, a volunteer for that organization’s goals. By decentralizing authority, HR, and finance, Swarmops makes it possible to scale an organization far beyond traditional methods. This philosophy of power through voluntary collaboration also aligns very well with Bitnation’s core values.

Using Swarmops, the Ambassador network can scale organically across the globe, from regional level down to city level, increasing in density dynamically as interest picks up in a location without central planning, approval, or intervention. As new Ambassador candidates rise to prominence through their actions and visibility, they can be assigned formal recognition in the Ambassador network in a completely decentralized process, without any bottlenecks or centralized approval requirements. In this way, the Ambassador network is expected to quickly grow to a point-of-contact network where you can always ask local people for a way in to Bitnation, looking from the viewpoint of a future client. This network also becomes a Bitnation-internal network of people across all geographic levels - city, region, continent. Swarmops handles this through its basic philosophy and its core functionality.

Swarmops runs on free software, and is free software itself, further aligning well with Bitnation’s core values. It is also going to handle Bitnation’s cryptocurrency-based accounting and provide complete transparency as well as large-scale inclusion, providing easy access to resources for the Ambassador network.


Other Coordination Tools:
==================

1. Skype chats and calls 
2. Facebook groups
3. Meetup groups
4. Trello boards
5. Google docs
6. Google hangout


Financial Sustainability:
==================

The Governance 2.0 DApp Library will charge a small transaction fee on DApps sold by 3rd party developers (Ambassadors, or others) and by Bitnation paying DApps (there will also be free DApps on the platform, developed by both Bitnation, and by 3rd Party developers. 

See the Bitnation GitHub for more on the financial model.
