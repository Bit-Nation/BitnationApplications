Blockchain Based Corporate Incorporation, Cryptoequity Emission, Management and Trading 

#1 GENERAL

Bitcorp is a blockchain based corporate incorporation Decentralized Application (DApp), a part of the BITNATION Pangea platform. Bitcorp intends to offer entrepreneurs corporate incorporation services, including company registry, shares emission and management, cryptoequity trading, fundraising, shareholder agreements and integration with other functions in the BITNATION ecosystem, such as BITNATION Passport, Dispute Resolution, and more. .

We're initially focused on countries in frontier- and emerging markets. Colombia or Cambodia are examples where incorporating a company is time consuming and expensive. Hence, small and medium size entrepreneurs struggle to protect their rights, assets, lend money, expand, and more. For instance, in Cambodia, it takes a whopping 104 days to incorporate a company, and its to expensive for people with an average income to do, hence most people do not incorporate at all. Which means they can’t sell equity to expand, they can’t use equity as a security to lend money, they can’t tie equity to, for instance, a will, a child care contract, or a marriage contract, and more. This prevents economic mobility in many parts of the world. BITNATION aims to change that through Bitcorp, to give entrepreneurs across the world financial access, security and mobility.

Further on, Bitcorp is also ideal for internet based organizations operating with cryptocurrencies. At a later stage we will integrate more advanced features tailored for the creation of other organizational models: Distributed Organizations (DO’s), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s), Decentralized Applications (DApp’s) and Distributed Collaborative Organization’s (DCO’s). Follow the Bitcorp GitHub for more updates on these organizational models.
